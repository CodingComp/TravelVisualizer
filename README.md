# Flight Visualizer
A unity project where you can visualize the places you have visited by using flight numbers / callsigns.

# Controls
- **Look** - Left Mouse Button (on earth) and drag
- **Zoom** - Mouse Scroll Wheel

# Features
- Import and export a CSV file of flights.
- Can hover over a visualized flight and see information about said flight.

*On the webgl build when clicking import or export you have to click anywhere again for the menu to pop up, don't know what causes this*
